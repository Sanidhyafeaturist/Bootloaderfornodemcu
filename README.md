you can run a bootloader in NodeMCU. The ESP8266 will enter the serial bootloader when GPIO0 is held low on reset. Otherwise, it will run the program in flash
Here's a diagram

If you dont know what is a bootloader then see this explanation


A bootloader is a small piece of software that is responsible for initializing the hardware of a computer or microcontroller and loading the main operating system or application program into memory. It's an essential component of the startup process and is typically the first software that runs when a device is powered on or restarted.

Bootloaders play a crucial role in enabling a device to start up and transition from a powered-off state to a functional state. Here's how a bootloader works:

Initialization: When a device is powered on, the bootloader initializes and configures the hardware components necessary for the system to operate, such as memory, processors, input/output devices, and more.

Loading the Operating System: In systems that use an operating system (like a computer or smartphone), the bootloader is responsible for loading the operating system kernel into memory. This is the core part of the OS that manages hardware resources and provides various services to applications.

Loading Applications: On embedded systems like microcontrollers or devices with specific firmware, the bootloader might load the main application code into memory.

User Interaction: Some bootloaders allow user interaction during startup. For example, they might provide options to boot into different modes or select from multiple operating systems if available.

Updating Firmware: Bootloaders are also often used for firmware updates. They can check for new firmware versions, download them, and update the device's firmware.

In the context of microcontrollers and embedded systems, bootloaders are particularly important. They enable developers to update the device's firmware without the need for specialized programming hardware. This is done by uploading new firmware over communication interfaces like USB, UART, or Ethernet.

For instance, in Arduino or microcontroller programming, the bootloader is a piece of software that resides in the microcontroller's memory and allows you to upload new programs to the microcontroller using a simple USB connection, without needing additional programming tools.

Different systems and devices have different bootloaders tailored to their requirements, and understanding how bootloaders work is important for developers working on firmware and low-level software.




Note - I am currently working on a project like this only and soon upgraded version of this bootloader will come
